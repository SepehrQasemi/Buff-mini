# Paper Trading Checklist

- Confirm config hash and run IDs are recorded before each session.
- Confirm execution mode and leverage source (Stage-3.3 or fallback defaults).
- Verify risk caps and kill-switch thresholds match approved values.
- Run Stage-4 simulator on latest local signals before enabling paper execution.
- Review cap scaling frequency and kill-switch trigger reasons.
- Re-evaluate according to cadence and minimum new-bar requirement.
